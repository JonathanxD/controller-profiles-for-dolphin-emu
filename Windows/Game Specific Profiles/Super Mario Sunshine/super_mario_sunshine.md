# Super Mario Sunshine Xbox Controller Profile

A modernized take on Super Mario Sunshine's control scheme. 
The right stick is inverted, making the camera controls just like any other modern platform game.

## Overridden commands

| Button | Action |
| --- | --- |
| LB | Open up the map |
| RB | F.L.U.D.D. "aim mode" |
| RT | Hold it to shoot water while running |

The rest of the commands works just like you expect.
